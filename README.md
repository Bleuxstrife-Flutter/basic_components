# Custom Basic Components

A bundle that contains our custom components, mostly just override the default Flutter widgets and custom its style and some of its functional.

*Note*: This plugin is still under development, and some Components might not be available yet or still has so many bugs.
- The date picker components inspired by [flutter_calendar_carousel](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/flutter_calendar_carousel#-readme-tab-), I clone it and override some of its functional and add selection types (single, multi or range)

## Installation

First, add `basic_components` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.io/platform-plugins/).

basic_components: ^0.0.18
